# PathFinder Visualizer Application

This application demonstrates how Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm computes the
shortest path from to a point.

# Running the Application
1) You'll need to download and have the associated python libraries installed
such as:
- Pygame
- TKinter

2) Open the command line or terminal and run the python file. It should generate a GUI
with a two options on it.
- Start: Click on this option to being game. It's recommended you check out the rules first.
- Rules: This explains how to properly set the target and obstacles and run the algorithm.
